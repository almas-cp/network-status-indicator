## üîç How It Works

Network Status Indicator uses two methods to check connectivity:

1. **Ping-based checks**: Uses subprocess to ping your target host
2. **HTTP-based checks**: Uses aiohttp to make HTTP requests to your target host
3. **Speed measurement**: Connects to Cloudflare's speed test endpoints to measure upload and download speeds

All operations run asynchronously to ensure the application remains responsive at all times.

## üìã Requirements

- Windows 10 or later
- For source installation:
  - Python 3.6+
  - PyQt5
  - aiohttp
  - asyncio

## üí° Tips

- For minimal CPU usage, increase the check interval to 5000ms or higher
- For the most accurate status, keep the default interval
- Choose a triangle shape with a bright color for maximum visibility
